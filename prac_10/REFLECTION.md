# Reflection

## 1. Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject? 

My accuracy in terms of estimated time taken for each practical task relatively improved over the course of CP1404.
I felt that although the tasks get more challenging as weeks go by, I also get more familiar with how fast I learn 
new Python concepts. For instance, Classes and Inheritance took me more time to grasp and I understood my 
own coding efficiency enough to make longer estimates and ended up with +/- 5 minutes difference for my
actual time taken. I would not have been this accurate about my estimates if I was timing myself
in the earlier weeks of practicals.

## 2. Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

As for code reviews, I realised that they were effective in helping programmers like myself learn from the perspective 
of other users who are largely on the same level as I am. In fact, being reviewed I found insights and
constructive criticism from peers very helpful in identifying mistakes or potential improvements, big or small, 
in our code which we might not have paid attention to. When I do reviews for my fellow classmates, I realised some of
them have preferences in the way they code, such as choosing try-except for error checking and Look-Before-You-Leap over
the Easier-to-Ask-For-Forgiveness-than-Permission approach. Some of them tend to repeat mistakes in areas taught
in this subject, like not including docstrings to describe their functions, which occur to me that it is easy to 
miss out the non-coding related skills when we get too focused on making our code functional
or to achieve the correct output.

## 3. Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were in charge of the subject, I would definitely extend the submission deadlines for each practical task, because
not every student is capable of learning how to code effectively using one new concept within a week and submit
the practical for that topic by the end of the same week. I am typically a slow-learner, so I would prefer to have more 
time internalising the content so that I need not rush to finish the practical before the deadline. I would also
lessen the intensity of this subject by making GUI programming like Kivy as 'Practice & Extensions' exercises.
