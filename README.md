## Programming with Python

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

Hi! My name is Riston and I am a student from JCUS learning how to code using the Python language! I took this subject
to learn how to read Python code... by that I mean understand how lines of code run and
what Python's in-built functions can do.

This repository serves as my stepping stone to professional Python programming in my future career,
as I tackle basic programs here and make mistakes which in hindsight allows me to look back
to review my thinking process.

Main Lessons on "Clean Code":

- The purpose of clean code is for users to easily understand the process of the code formation and
  for programmers to swiftly pinpoint any errors to rectify.
- Clean code can be achieved by following best practices of presenting code such as string formatting and
  using good naming conventions.
- When dealing with functions ensure each of them follow the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and include
  docstrings for each function to describe what it does.
